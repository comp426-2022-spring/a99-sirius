# Introduction 

Sirius is an open source task management web application that will also be implemented as a mobile application in the future as well. Users of the application will be able to login and sign-up using a username/email and password, or through different authentications such as Google Authentication and Github Authentication. The purpose of the authenticator was to implement a two-factor authentication that helps verify user identities before granting them access to our website. It provides extra layer of security to only grant authorized users to the website. 
The responsive task management app consists of creating tasks, deleting tasks, and searching for a specific task that the user wants to find. There are additional features and components when creating a new task in order to aid utilization of the application. The users can add when the task date is due with an integrated calendar, set a priority of the specific task, and set a reminder so they can be aware of when the task will be due.
The lists below includes instructions and contributors to the project.

## Deliverables
This github repository contains the code for a simple task management web application. The package will take the form of a node/react package, with several dependencies needed to be installed in order to properly run the website. The following script command is needed in order to run the website:

### To run the application locally:

1. Open your terminal and run the following command to install server dependencies:

     `npm install`
    
2. Access the client directory and install all dependencies

     `cd/client`
     
     `npm install/`
   
3. Go back to the main riectory and run the following command to start the server and run the client side concurrently

     `..`
     
      `npm run dev`
     
4. The client side will be running on http://localhost:3000 and the server in http://localhost:5555  

## Project Goals
Create a task managent application.

This will include:
* Creating an account locally.
* Signing in through Google/Github *Note: GitHub Authentication in production enviroment will be disabled*
* If singing in with Google/Github the user will be able to set his own password.
* Signing into the application locally.
* Connecting a database in order to store/authenticate logging information.
* Connection a database to fetch user tasks and task status.
* Allow users to create/remove tasks.
* Allow user to modify task status and toggle reminders.

Future Implementations might include:
* Implement a Calendar API Future Impplementation
* Allow users to collaborate on tasks
* Give the users the ability to add other users
* Add time's to complete certain tasks

## Stages 
* Backend Design
* Databases Schemas and Connection
* Backend Implementation
* Front End Design
* Backend / Front End Connection
* CSS for styling


## First steps

Other steps that you will need to take after your team has accepted the assignment:

1. Choose a license and update the LICENSE file accordingly. 
2. Edit this README.md file and use it as the main location of your technical documentation with links out to information contained under `/docs/`.
3. Create a `/docs/` directory for more elaborate documentation of your API, planning notes, etc.
4. Make sure that all of your team members have access to the repository as administrators.
5. Create a project under the **Projects** tab. Use this to manage your planning. Create a To-do list, etc. Explore the tools available and user them to manage your project.
7. Assign team roles and include a listing of those roles in this README.md file or in another file under `/docs/`.
8. Then put your entire development workflow in this repository.
9. Use **Pull requests** to propose changes and incorporate them into your code from various team members. 
10. Use **Issues** to identify and track bugs and also to communicate about various aspects of the project.

## Team mangement

Plan to meet with your team ASAP.
Talk through identifying roles within your team.

Try to figure out what each of you are good at/enjoy doing and try to work out roles that incorporate that.

Some basic roles you will want to consider:

1. A review manager - someone to review pull requests and merge or reject them and manage the related discussions
2. A plan manager - someone to keep an eye on the overall plan and keep the project tab/to-do list up to date
3. A documentation manager - someone to keep the documentation in order and identify what is missing and needs to be documented
4. A release manager - someone to manage the packaging and release process for your prototype package
5. A project manager - someone keeping track of all the moving parts and make sure that everything that needs to happen is happening.
5. Roles for team members to take charge or different parts of the project. Possible roles:
    1. Front end lead
    2. Back end lead
    3. Database lead
    4. Design lead
    5. Etc.

You will notice that there are more roles than people in your group.
That is because you will all be doing a hybrid job of managing a thing while working on other things.

## Check in with instructional staff

Schedule a few times throughout the rest of the semester for your team to check-in with your assigned instructional staff member during their scheduled office hours. 

## Assignment instructions

And that is about all you need to get started.
